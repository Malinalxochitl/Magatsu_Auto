AutoHotKey script

Clicks on GUI elements in an infinite loop for automated farming

Only works on MuMu currently but feel free to edit the following line in the main script if you want use something else.

uid := WinExist("Magatsu - MuMu App Player") <--change the text within the quotation marks to what you're using

You can find out the window title of whatever emulator you're using with the WindowSpy script that comes with your ahk installation.
Different emulators or graphics cards sometimes render images slightly differently so replacing the images in Pics with your own screenshots can help you if the script isn't recognizing the images

pls no ban
