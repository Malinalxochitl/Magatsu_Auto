# Magatsu_Auto
AutoHotKey script

Automatically clicks on the gui elements as follows in an infinite loop:

Ready -> OK -> autobattle icon -> skip -> Retry

Only works on MuMu currently but feel free to edit line 38 in the main script if you want use anything else.

uid := WinExist("Magatsu - MuMu App Player") <--this one

You can find out the window title of whatever emulator you're using with the WindowSpy script that comes with your ahk installation.
Different emulators or graphics cards sometimes render images slightly differently so replacing the images in Pics with your own screenshots can help you if the script isn't recognizing the images

pls no ban
